&lt;p&gt;I have been working with WordPress &lt;em&gt;professionally&lt;/em&gt; for over 3 years now, and over the years I’ve made many, many mistakes. With all those mistakes, I’ve learned a lot of things as well. I’d like to share some tips for other developers out there so they do not make the same mistakes I’ve made.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;1---never-trust-the-client-and-always-escape-your-outputs&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#1---never-trust-the-client-and-always-escape-your-outputs&quot; aria-label=&quot;1   never trust the client and always escape your outputs permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#1 - Never trust the client, and always escape your outputs.&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This should be a given for every developer but I want to stress it anyway. If your plugin, or theme, or function, outputs any data or accepts input of any kind at all, you must sanitize, escape and encode it properly. Trust me. I’ve done this mistake and its not fun. Always use protection when it comes to data. However, when you’re using WP functions such as &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;the_title()&lt;/code&gt; you don’t have to escape these functions as WordPress already provides you the escaped/sanitized text. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;2---you-dont-have-to-re-invent-the-wheel&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#2---you-dont-have-to-re-invent-the-wheel&quot; aria-label=&quot;2   you dont have to re invent the wheel permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#2 - You don’t have to re-invent the wheel&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you’re creating custom plugins or themes, its easy to do everything from scratch. Before you do that however just know that there are tons of useful and battle tested functions and methods you can make use of. Especially If you’re creating a plugin for WooCommerce you will notice a lot of re-usable functions. I once spent a whole day fiddling with PHP Curl only to realize (way too late) that I could have simply used &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wp_remote_get&lt;/code&gt;. Functions like these are amazing and the hard work is already done for you. You can hit the ground running instead of like me, spending a whole day trying to do PHP curls. I’ve been working with WordPress for over three years and I still discover new functions that I can use to make my life easier. Before you start, my recommendation would be to see if there is a function within WordPress or WooCommerce that already does what you’re after.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&quot;3---dont-be-the-bloat&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#3---dont-be-the-bloat&quot; aria-label=&quot;3   dont be the bloat permalink&quot; class=&quot;anchor&quot;&gt;&lt;svg aria-hidden=&quot;true&quot; focusable=&quot;false&quot; height=&quot;16&quot; version=&quot;1.1&quot; viewBox=&quot;0 0 16 16&quot; width=&quot;16&quot;&gt;&lt;path fill-rule=&quot;evenodd&quot; d=&quot;M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z&quot;&gt;&lt;/path&gt;&lt;/svg&gt;&lt;/a&gt;#3 - Don’t be the bloat&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress is full of bloat, we all know this. Its a common complaint of WordPress. When you’re creating plugins and themes, you want to always ensure you have performance in mind. Sometimes its hard but one trick I’ve learned over the years is to use transient API for short term caching. You might be wondering why use transient instead of &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wp_object_cache&lt;/code&gt;? Well transient API is the same thing, in fact if you have persistent cache enabled, transient API will use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;wp_object_cache&lt;/code&gt; in the background. If you have a function that is making a bunch of calls to the database, you should try to see how you can cache data in order to eliminate constant database querying.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can write a whole novel when it comes to WordPress and providing tips but I wanted to keep this short and sweet. I hope someone out there will benefit from this and avoid some common mistakes that are easy to commit. &lt;/p&gt;

And like they say, opinions are like &lt;em&gt;assholes&lt;/em&gt;, everyone has one. My opinion could be wrong so take what I’m saying here with a grain of salt. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When it comes to developer’s opinion on anything at all, you can almost guarentee there will be disagreement. Which language is better (rhetorical please dont answer), tabs or spaces, Mac or PC for development, which editor is ideal, etc etc. However, there will always be something that unites developers. That is the hatred of WordPress. Unfortunately, I’m the guy with the unpopular opinion that breaks this unification.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/e88b9c18f34b8de804f8978f012ad608/uhoh.gif&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now wait, before you all take out your pitchforks and come after my developer card, I’d like to mention something. I agree with many people that WordPress is not the best. &lt;em&gt;But it doesn’t suck&lt;/em&gt;. It clearly does not suck. It does some things really well actually which is why it has such tremendous success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Legitimate Developer concers about WordPress are totally valid. When talking about poorly optimized databases, global variables, cron, inconsistent functionality, &lt;em&gt;gutenburg&lt;/em&gt;, absolute paths, maintenance nightmare and spaghetti code, you can totally make the case that WordPress sucks for developers. We know better, and all of these things I just listed off makes us die a little inside.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, WordPress was never created for Developers. There is no Developer experience when it comes to WordPress. WordPress’ purpose is Content Management. Sure, you can argue it does that poorly at times, but its good enough to generate value for many businesses. As a small business owner I doubt you care whether or not WordPress still supports PHP5. You just want a cheap, functioning website that you can update yourself. This is where WordPress shines. The real power of WordPress is truly seen when you can take the platform and turn it into a multi million dollar business. Its possible and I’ve seen it happen.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think of it like taking a work tractor to the track for a race and then being upset that all the super cars are faster. The tractor doesn’t suck, you’re just using it wrong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Part of the issue is that a lot of people who call themselves ‘WordPress developers’ are not really developers at all and they muddy up the term. Don’t get me wrong, I’m not talking about the person who codes their own themes and plugins, I’m talking about the person who updates a few settings and changes a few options to make a page look shiny and then calls themself a developer. When the 60th plugin they installed begins to break, they can no longer fix things by changing options and then give up claiming WordPress sucks. Then, a real developer gets called in, takes one good look at that hot mess of a garbage, realizes he’s in hell and then peaces out claiming WordPress sucks. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this scenario WordPress does not suck. The person who strangled the website with 60 different plugins suck. If you’ve ever seen a website built like this you know the horrors. There are at least 22 plugins ready to update. The WordPress core version is 3 major version behind. You try to update a plugin and then it asks you for FTP credentials. Its a nightmare. Nothing was setup right and everything that could have gone wrong, has gone wrong. &lt;em&gt;By the way I’m a little guilty of doing this so I’m sorry!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, the fact that anyone anywhere can create themes and plugins for the platform is a double sided coin. There is a plugin for literally every sort of functionality you can expect from a website. You can turn WordPress into an &lt;em&gt;app&lt;/em&gt; (not recommended). With this level of freedom and power comes a lot of responsibility. Remember how earlier I said Developers can rarely agree on things? Well now imagine all these different opinions, coding styles, and skills being used to create plugins and themes. I’m not a gambler but I can bet any amount of money there will be conflicts. (&lt;em&gt;Also guilty of creating shitty plugins so sorry again!&lt;/em&gt;) Knowing this, people install tons of custom plugins on the platform and then look like surprised pikachu when it all comes crumbling down. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;WordPress is a tool and for many businesses it is a brilliant solution. With the right theme and the right set of plugins, a small business website can function for years with no issues. There are thousands of successful WordPress websites. It will be very hard to argue they all suck. I’m simply trying to make the point that when it comes to WordPress, its usually the implementation that goes wrong. If you install 60 mods on a car which are not built specifically for it, and the car no longer functions at 100%, would you blame the car?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;WordPress generates value for a lot of businesses. If the platform is used right it can generate a lot more value for a lot more people.&lt;/p&gt;

This is my nth try in creating a personal website to showcase my work, speak my mind and to share my experiences with all of you. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/3089ff53a1a8a22cc068531a5378518e/hello-world.gif&quot; alt=&quot;lonely im mr lonely i have nobody for my own&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As this is my first post, I’ll mention a few things about myself. I’m a front-end Web Applications developer working out of Kitchener Canada. Since I was a little kid I’ve always been interested in computers and the things you could do on a computer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Over the years I’ve taught myself how to edit graphics, create mods for games, build bots for lols and a lot of other neat things. I have to give credit to gaming as a lot of my curiousity came from the fact that I could change and alter my favourite games by modding them. This opened my eyes to the power of being able to program a computer application to do what I wanted. There was a time where I would spend months writting bots so that I could save time doing mundane tasks in games.. These days I still code but mainly web applications, working with React, Electron, etc. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aside from my passion for computers, I also really like gardening. It was something that I picked up as part of an office ‘challenge’ which was to grow tomatoes. It really sparked an interest. I have plans to setup a Raspberry pi project to help me with gardening at home but I haven’t gotten around to that yet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That is all for now, its hard to write about myself, its awkward and feels like im patting myself in the back over nothing :) Anyway thanks for reading and if you have any questions or comments you can always feel free to reach me through email or instagram. &lt;/p&gt;
