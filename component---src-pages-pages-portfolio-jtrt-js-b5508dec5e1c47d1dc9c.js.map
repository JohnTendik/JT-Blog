We needed a plugin that would take excel results and turn it into responsive tables to be displayed on the KWRC website.</p>\n\n        <p>Originally the project was very simple. All it did was take excel file and display an HTML table. This worked great for KWRC and what they needed at the time. I decided to release this plugin into the WordPress plugin directory and it was one of the best decisions I've made.</p>\n\n        <img src='https://johntendik.github.io/img/port2.png' />\n\n        <p>Really quickly the plugin gained around 500 active users (now over 5000). To me this was a huge success and really inspired me to improve upon the plugin.</p>\n\n        <p>I added a ton of new features, and made the plugin overall more easier to use. Thinking back to it now, had I continued to work on this plugin and improved it more I'm sure it would have gotten a lot more popular than it currently is. I haven't touched the plugin in over a year and I still get people messaging me about helping them use it. Unfortunately I no longer have the time or interest to continue to support this plugin.</p>\n\n        <strong>Tools used:</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>HTML5 / CSS3</li>\n          <li>PHP / MYSQL</li>\n          <li>WordPress</li>\n          <li>JavaScript</li>\n          <li>SASS / SCSS</li>\n          <li>Bootstrap</li>\n          <li>Footables</li>\n          <li>Papa Parse</li>\n          <li>Handsontable</li>\n          <li>Stack Overflow</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <a href='https://en-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/jtrt-responsive-tables/' target='_blank'>View project</a>\n      </Page>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\nexport default JTRTpage"],"sourceRoot":""}
