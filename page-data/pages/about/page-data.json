They were usually voiced by another 10 year old, and it was always the right answer for your problems. Having this kind of access to knowledge I quickly picked up how to ‘code’. Back then, it was basically copy pasting css blocks into myspace, but still, it was code. Had to have those flashy cursor trails amiright?</p>\n<p>My love for coding really happened because of online gaming. In the earlier stages of the internet, a simple line of JavaScript could break entire networks. Security was pretty much null. I spent a lot of time in forums trying to learn from what others have created. Usually it was some sort of bot or cheat program. I loved that you could cheat in an online game to gain an advantage over others. Had to have those fake coins amiright? Anyway, as I tried tirelessly trying to mod and cheat my favourite games (often failing), I picked up on programming. It started with VB Basic. It was the easiest and most appealing programming language to pick up since it was so UI friendly. Drag on a button, double click, and make function do something. It was awesome. </p>\n<p>After a while when security was becoming a thing, I realized I didn’t like spending hours trying to decipher some network logs just to create an exploit. Instead I began focusing my time on creating things like fan websites, clan websites, forum signatures, etc. My focus became web developement instead of web destruction. Fast forward to today, Im a full time Intermediate Software Developer (Front End) working with technologies like React, Electron, CSS Grids, etc, and I’m lovin’ in. I also do part time management of a WordPress website which allows me to keep my overall skills in check, not just front-end.</p>\n<p>If you have questions, or would like to know more, shoot me an email!</p>\n<p>-JT</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"About me","date":null,"description":null,"socialImage":"/media/internet-guide.jpg"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/pages/about/"}}}
