This tool / bot / program was the best idea ever. I even programmed a feature that would auto walk around the block to hatch eggs. I would be sitting in class and 'walking' for miles in game. I hatched a lot of 10km eggs just by sitting. My bag was full from, couldn't even hold more pokeballs at the time.</p>\n\n        <p>There was also another neat feature which was walking to the nearest gym. This was even lazier than having a joystick on the page. This was automated playing at this point. The last feature to add was auto gym battle but I never got around to finishing it. The developers of Pokemon Go outright removed support for any device that was rooted or jailbroken. This meant I couldn't even play the game <em>fairly</em> :D At this point though the damage was done.</p>\n\n        <strong>Tools used:</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>Stack Overflow</li>\n          <li>Google</li>\n          <li>Java</li>\n          <li>Android Studio</li>\n          <li>Pokemon API</li>\n          <li>Joystick View</li>\n          <li>Google Login Services</li>\n          <li>Google Maps</li>\n          <li>Google Directions</li>\n          <li>Root/Jailbreak</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <a href='https://github.com/JohnTendik/LazyGo' target='_blank'>View project</a>\n      </Page>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\nexport default LazyGo"],"sourceRoot":""}
