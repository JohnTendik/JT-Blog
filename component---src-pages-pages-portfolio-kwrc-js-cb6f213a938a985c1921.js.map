Sounds boring to a lot of people but to me its the most fun and exciting thing ever. Yes, you read that right. I really enjoy Motorsports, especially ones where the control of the car is the important part (drifting, rally, rally cross, etc), probably because I always feel like I can compete (and stand a chance) unlike any other sports.</p>\n\n        <p>When I learned that in my city there was a local rally club I immedietely went to sign up as a member. Unfortunately this proved a bit difficult because their old website was, well, a little bit outdated. It was hard to find information or dates for events. The sign up process looked ancient and frankly being a developer I didn't really trust it.</p>\n\n        <img src='https://johntendik.github.io/img/port1.png' />\n        <small><em>Image above is the new website that I built.

This site was my very first WordPress theme. It was an introduction to the powers of WordPress. It still runs today, like 5 years later which is incredibly surprising to me.</p>\n\n        <strong>Tools used:</strong>\n        <ul>\n          <li>HTML5 / CSS3</li>\n          <li>PHP / MYSQL</li>\n          <li>WordPress</li>\n          <li>JavaScript</li>\n          <li>SASS / SCSS</li>\n          <li>Bootstrap</li>\n          <li>Photoshop</li>\n          <li>Illustrator</li>\n        </ul>\n\n        <a href='http://kwrc.on.ca' target='_blank'>View project</a>\n      </Page>\n    </Layout>\n  );\n}\nexport default KWRCpage"],"sourceRoot":""}
