Hello World! This is my nth try in creating a personal website to showcase my work, speak my mind and to share my experiences with all of you. 

![lonely im mr lonely i have nobody for my own](/media/hello-world.gif)

As this is my first post, I'll mention a few things about myself. I'm a front-end Web Applications developer working out of Kitchener Canada. Since I was a little kid I've always been interested in computers and the things you could do on a computer.

Over the years I've taught myself how to edit graphics, create mods for games, build bots for lols and a lot of other neat things. I have to give credit to gaming as a lot of my curiousity came from the fact that I could change and alter my favourite games by modding them. This opened my eyes to the power of being able to program a computer application to do what I wanted. There was a time where I would spend months writting bots so that I could save time doing mundane tasks in games.. These days I still code but mainly web applications, working with React, Electron, etc. 

Aside from my passion for computers, I also really like gardening. It was something that I picked up as part of an office 'challenge' which was to grow tomatoes. It really sparked an interest. I have plans to setup a Raspberry pi project to help me with gardening at home but I haven't gotten around to that yet.

That is all for now, its hard to write about myself, its awkward and feels like im patting myself in the back over nothing :) Anyway thanks for reading and if you have any questions or comments you can always feel free to reach me through email or instagram.
